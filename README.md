# scribblIOCustomPrep
Python scripts that take in lists of custom words and gets rid of duplicates and unnecessary spaces

Requires python3.
In the same directory, there must be a text file named "scribblIO.txt" in which there are words separated by commas.
This script will go through the list and get rid of apostropes and duplicate words while also converting to lower-case.
Finally, it will output the new list to "scribblIO_unique.txt" with no spaces next to the commas, no duplcates, and no apostrophes.

*Apostrophes are not included because for some reason they are not scoreable in the scribblIO game*
